## Tests

- Unit tests are in test/jest/unit.

## CI configuration

- Set the environment variables in the CI environment variable section.
- The only command needed to be put on CI is 'yarn setup' which tests formatting with prettier, eslint errors, typescript errors and all tests.

## Deploy

1. First, be sure you did all steps from the configuration section.
2. 'yarn build' command will compile all files and put them into build folder.
3. Install Apache. (I'm using XAMPP for this example. Link: [Apache](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html))
4. Clean up htdocs folder of xampp/htdocs.
5. Put all files from dist folder into xampp/htdocs folder.
6. Open XAMPP and, on the line of module apache, click on the 'Start' button.
7. Access 'localhost' from your browser and see that the page loads correctly. It will still not work if you try to access a route manually (like 'localhost/login'). See below how to fix it.

- For react router works correctly, you need to create a file '.htaccess' in the root of htdocs directory. Put this info there:

```bash
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```
